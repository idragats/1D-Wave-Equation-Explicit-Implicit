#  1D Wave Equation Explicit/Implicit
## Computational Electromagnetics
In this program we create a matlab code to study the 1Dimension wave equation explict and implicit. 
We use FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) method. 
Explicit method means that the wave vlocity at the next time level (n+1) depens on the wave velocity at previous time level (n-1) and current time level (n).
Also, Implicit method means that the wave velocity can be calculated on every node at the same time.
